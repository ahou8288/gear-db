Todo:
Connvert all tables into one table with buttons for categories
When viewing the borrow tables have one line for each borrow_group_id with multiple items show at once.
Add an overdue field to borrow tables
Change code to handle changes to fields in a uniform way (all gear tables from one fields list if possible)
	Make tables all get fields from controller
	Make tables have select inputs at the bottom
	Make controllers get and send fields
	Make models return fields
