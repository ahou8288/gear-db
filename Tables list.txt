All fields from model or controller.

Tables list;
--gear view - fields + retired, fields
edit gear - fields + retired + deleted

borrow view - fields from borrow and gear name and gear category
borrow - people without deleted, gear without deleted and retired
return_table - same as borrow view
return - gear without deleted and retired

people view - people without deleted
edit people - people with deleted

Plan -
All fields only stored in models
Models send data which is ready for javascript.
models -> controllers -> views

eg all gear fields come from one function
